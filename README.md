Welcome to my project submission for the **Belajar Machine Learning Pemula** course by Dicoding! üöÄ This project focuses on analyzing video game sales data using **clustering** and **classification** techniques. The dataset used is **Video Game Sales with Ratings**, which includes sales data and ratings from Metacritic. Let's dive into the details! üïπÔ∏è

## üìÅ About the Dataset

### **Context**
This dataset combines video game sales data from **VGChartz** with corresponding ratings from **Metacritic**. It includes information about game titles, platforms, genres, publishers, sales across different regions, and critic/user ratings. The dataset contains approximately **6,900 complete cases**.

### **Features**
Here are the key features in the dataset:

1. **Name**: Name of the game (e.g., "Wii Sports", "Super Mario Bros.").
2. **Platform**: Platform or console where the game was released (e.g., "Wii", "PS4").
3. **Year_of_Release**: Year the game was released (e.g., 2006, 1985).
4. **Genre**: Genre or category of the game (e.g., "Sports", "Action").
5. **Publisher**: Company that published the game (e.g., "Nintendo", "Electronic Arts").
6. **Sales Data**: Sales in millions of units for different regions:
   - **NA_Sales**: North America
   - **EU_Sales**: Europe
   - **JP_Sales**: Japan
   - **Other_Sales**: Other regions
   - **Global_Sales**: Total worldwide sales
7. **Ratings**:
   - **Critic_Score**: Aggregate score from Metacritic critics (0-100).
   - **Critic_Count**: Number of critics contributing to the score.
   - **User_Score**: Aggregate score from Metacritic users (0-10).
   - **User_Count**: Number of users contributing to the score.
8. **Developer**: Company or team that developed the game.
9. **Rating**: ESRB rating (e.g., "E" for Everyone, "T" for Teen).

## üéØ Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Clustering**: Group video games into clusters based on their features (e.g., sales, ratings, genre).
2. **Classification**: Build a model to classify games into clusters using supervised learning techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### **Clustering**
I used **K-Means Clustering** to group the games into **3 clusters** based on features like sales, ratings, and release year. Here's a summary of the clusters:

1. **Cluster 0**:
   - **Average Release Year**: 2008
   - **Low Critic and User Scores**: Critic Score: 56, User Score: 4.9
   - **Dominant Genre**: Action
   - **Dominant Platform**: X360
   - **Analysis**: Games in this cluster have low sales and ratings, targeting a general audience (Rating: E).

2. **Cluster 1**:
   - **Average Release Year**: 2006
   - **Moderate Critic and User Scores**: Critic Score: 71, User Score: 7.6
   - **Dominant Genre**: Action
   - **Dominant Platform**: X360
   - **Analysis**: Games in this cluster have higher sales and better ratings, targeting teens (Rating: T).

3. **Cluster 2**:
   - **Average Release Year**: 2006
   - **High Sales and Ratings**: Critic Score: 69, User Score: 7.6
   - **Dominant Genre**: Action
   - **Dominant Platform**: PS2
   - **Analysis**: Games in this cluster have the highest sales and quality, dominating the North American and European markets.

### **Classification**
After clustering, I used the cluster labels to train two classification models:
1. **Random Forest**:
   - Achieved **99.88% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning.
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: **99.88%**.
   - Robust and generalizes well to new data.

2. **Decision Tree**:
   - Achieved **99.88% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning.
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: **99.88%**.
   - Simple and interpretable but prone to overfitting.

## üìä Results and Insights

- **Clustering**: The games were successfully grouped into 3 clusters based on sales, ratings, and other features. Each cluster represents a distinct market segment.
- **Classification**: Both Random Forest and Decision Tree models achieved **99.88% accuracy**, demonstrating excellent performance in predicting cluster labels.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use cross-validation to ensure models generalize well to new data.
  - Explore other algorithms like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost for further improvements.
  - Analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.
